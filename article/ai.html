      <h1 id="Three-Questions-about-Libraries-and-AI"><a href="#Three-Questions-about-Libraries-and-AI" class="headerlink" title="Three Questions about Libraries and AI"></a>Three Questions about Libraries and AI</h1><h2 id="Question-1-Do-libraries-capture-the-true-value-of-AI"><a href="#Question-1-Do-libraries-capture-the-true-value-of-AI" class="headerlink" title="Question 1: Do libraries capture the true value of AI?"></a>Question 1: Do libraries capture the true value of AI?</h2><p>When we librarians talk about AI, we usually associate it with robotics and digital content – most of the current AI projects in libraries tend to have a focus on these two topics. For example, AI can <a href="https://library.cityofpaloalto.org/browse_program/play-with-robot/" target="_blank" rel="external">make robots smart</a>, it can automatically <a href="http://library.stanford.edu/blogs/digital-library-blog/2018/10/library-inspired-artificial-intelligence-discovery-part-1" target="_blank" rel="external">generate metadata for images and books</a>, and it can <a href="https://petapixel.com/2019/03/05/colourise-sg-uses-ai-to-colorize-bw-photos/" target="_blank" rel="external">colorize archived photos</a> etc.. While there is nothing wrong with this, it makes us blindfolded from the true value of AI. We do not think of AI in the way of improving library performance. </p>
<p>Should libraries care more about this? A <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/artificial-intelligence/the-promise-and-challenge-of-the-age-of-artificial-intelligence" target="_blank" rel="external">recent research</a> shows that AI has the potential to improve library performance by 87% if we put libraries in the same bucket of bookstores and Amazon Books (the retail category in the image below). Suppose the estimate becomes reality, libraries could get further marginalized in the future if we do not start transforming now.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Featured%20Insights/Artificial%20Intelligence/The%20promise%20and%20challenge%20of%20the%20age%20of%20artificial%20intelligence/SVGZ-The-promise-and-challenge-Ex1.ashx" alt="img"></p>
<p>The major advantage of AI lies in its ability to help humans identify hidden patterns and trends in big data. The size and magnitude of big data are simply too far fetched for the capacity of human brains. We need machines’ assistance to handle the overflow of information in many domains and areas. For example, if a library collects the reference desk data at a very granular level and feed years of the data in an AI model, AI might generate unexpected finings and predictions that a 20-year reference librarian might not be able to discover and conclude. What kind of benefits can be derived from this? Combined with AI’s findings and human expert’s judgement, a library can train staff with more specific goals in mind, assign reference shifts by popular locations and by peak time and peak days, change library hours to work better with customers, pinpoint promotions to customer’s interests, redesign the library space (shelves, signs etc. ) as needed, develop programs around customers’ pain points etc.. AI and machine learning can make libraries more efficient, responsive and proactive. I am looking forward to see practical use cases of AI in library operations in the near future. </p>
<h2 id="Question-2-Are-libraries-AI-friendly"><a href="#Question-2-Are-libraries-AI-friendly" class="headerlink" title="Question 2: Are libraries AI friendly?"></a>Question 2: Are libraries AI friendly?</h2><p>The answer is probably no.</p>
<p>Financially, the current grant and budget plan in libraries do not work well with new technology projects. For an AI project, we probably need budget to cover the long-term subscription cost with cloud servers, cloud storage, cloud computing, api calls etc.. So a new financial model similar to that of electronic resources needs to be established first if libraries want to test the water of AI. </p>
<p>Content wisely, libraries are caught offhanded. </p>
<p>Are your library’s website and other public information machine readable and machine friendly? Does your library’s website have an API? Does your catalog have an API? Does your library’s calendar have an API, or at least, an RSS feed? When adopting AI, machines will need all kinds of relevant resources for data analytics. There should be a quick and easy way for machines to get the most up-to-date information, as well as historical data, without much human intervention. To use the NAO robot project I am leading at my library as example, we were trying to develop the robot so people can ask a question like “is the library open?” You would assume it’s a simple task that can be realized in a few lines of code, but turns out the solution is quite intertwined. Our main library website does not have an API yet,  so the machine needs to take the slow process to check multiple places. First it reads the regular schedule webpage and capture the information. Then it reads the events RSS feed to see if there is any planned or unexpected closures at any branches on a specific day. Finally, it consolidates both findings for the output.</p>
<h2 id="Question-3-Have-libraries-curated-qualified-big-data-to-train-a-library-centered-AI"><a href="#Question-3-Have-libraries-curated-qualified-big-data-to-train-a-library-centered-AI" class="headerlink" title="Question 3: Have libraries curated qualified big data to train a library centered AI?"></a>Question 3: Have libraries curated qualified big data to train a library centered AI?</h2><p>The answer is yes and no. </p>
<p>Libraries have plenty statistics data, which is good, meaning we are in a good shape if we want to develop a prediction model similar to the stock market. </p>
<p>However, the piece of data missing is the raw human-centered data. In the reference desk instance I gave above, this means libraries should record the very questions asked by customers. Before AI, saving this type of data was a waste of time, but if we want to train a library centered AI, we certainly need granular human-centered data in many places. An analogy to this would be if we want to develop a Natural Language Processing(NLP) model, we have to rely on an existing dataset to let the machine learn how different people narrate questions differently. A lot of NLP data set are from sources like Wikipedia, CNN, Daily Mail, Gutenberg books, Twitter, Reddit etc.. I run into this issue of lacking raw data when I started to develop the Nao robot to have the question and answer features similar to Alexa and Siri. Michael Hibben from Roanoke County Library, who is leading a project to develop a Pepper robot, run into the same issue as well. Michael and I have no other options but to take up the manual process of slowly creating an artificial training data set. This means we have to manually come up with a bunch of questions, and sometimes answers as well, to train the AI model. This is not the ideal solution. Now if a library already has a web-based reference service and the questions are archived, they probably have a head start to develop a library-centered chatbot. That being said, libraries probably would never want to develop a completely AI based chatbot. A fully AI-based chatbot will have the opacity issue (see definition of opacity issue in the next section) by generating nonsense, misleading or stupid answers. This is certainly against the library’s goal of providing accurate and authoritative information to its customers.</p>
<h2 id="Some-other-thoughts-on-AI"><a href="#Some-other-thoughts-on-AI" class="headerlink" title="Some other thoughts on AI"></a>Some other thoughts on AI</h2><p>I am an advocator of artificial intelligence despite its shortcomings and I can tell you why by sharing my thoughts on some commonly acknowledged challenges created by AI. These challenges are best summarized as <a href="https://www.scitecheuropa.eu/artificial-intelligence-algorithms/92324/" target="_blank" rel="external">opacity, neutrality and stupidity</a> by Professor Pellio, Director of the European Centre for Living Technology. </p>
<p>Opacity means that most of the times, how AI produces an output is a black box to humans, including its very own developers. This is because modern AI algorithms like the deep neuron network uses thousands of iterations and millions of parameters to determine the outputs. Stupidity means sometimes AI can easily get fooled and produce stupid outputs. These do not prevent AI to be useful. My take on this is that we should only use AI as an assistant or a tool to augment human abilities. We should never put our full trust in a tool. Humans know to question and doubt, while the current generation of AI is pretty single-minded and narrowly focused on a specific task in a specific domain. My other take is that AI will cause less controversial and become more useful if it is kept at the backend, similar to the ILS technology, in<br>libraries. </p>
<p>Neutrality is a much tougher issue. Why AI is biased? AI is not neutral because it gets its knowledge from data generated by humans. Hence, it inherits human prejudices and discriminations recorded in the source data. A good analogy is a library’s collection, which is biased in the same way too. I bet there is bad data like improper words or biased comments or unacceptable attitudes in some books in your library’s collection. Something widely accepted 50 years ago might become unacceptable now, and we can think of lots of examples. AI’s bias is rooted in humans, so this is not a new problem but unfortunately, new technology like AI may amplify it exponentially. Is there an ultimate solution to this? Should we hide the dark side of humans when we train a machine?  If yes, how do we cherry pick and censor the training data set? And by who’s standards? Here I would like to use a quote by Latoya Perterson, cofounder of the blog Racialicious, from the book Algorithms of Oppression: “…racism API is tweaked to be context specific, but it’s all the same source code. The key to its undoing is recognizing how many of us are ensnared in these same basic patterns and modifying our own actions. “</p>
